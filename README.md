# Video AI Summarizer Using Google Gemini AI

This project implements a Video AI Summarizer using Google's Gemini AI model and tools like DuckDuckGo for supplementary web research. 
The application is built using Gradio for a user-friendly interface, allowing users to upload video files and seek specific insights based on their queries.

Key Features
1. Video Upload: Supports common video formats like .mp4, .mov, and .avi.
2. Query-based Analysis: Users can provide questions or seek insights from video content.
3. AI-Powered Analysis: Utilizes Google Gemini AI for multimodal processing.
4. Dynamic Updates: Processes video files and fetches insights interactively.
5. Expandable: Ready for cloud-based storage integration (Google Cloud Storage - commented out for now).
